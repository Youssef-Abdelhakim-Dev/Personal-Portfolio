# ðŸŒŸ My Portfolio

> I'm super excited to share my latest portfolio project! I designed it to be visually appealing, dynamic, and fully interactive.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

1. **React.js**  
   - Chosen for building the User Interface (UI).  
   - The page is divided into multiple components like `Skills.js`, `Projects.js`, etc., then combined into a single cohesive structure.

2. **Styled-Components**  
   - For styling the website, managing colors, and creating a visually consistent design.

3. **Swiper.js**  
   - To create smooth sliders for the projects section.

4. **Framer Motion**  
   - Responsible for all animations across the website.

5. **React-Icons**  
   - For adding intuitive and stylish icons throughout the portfolio.

6. **Supabase**  
   - Makes the website dynamic.  
   - Allows adding, updating, or deleting content without modifying the code.  
   - For example, adding a new project in Supabase automatically updates the website for all visitorsâ€”no need to build a backend from scratch with PHP or Node.js.

7. **D3.js**  
   - For creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations.
